    "# At the age of six, Obama and his mother had moved to Indonesia to join his stepfather. From age six to ten, he attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.[32][33] As a result of his four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child.[34] During his time in Indonesia, Obama's stepfather taught him to be resilient and gave him \"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works.\"[35]\n",
    "# In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School—a private college preparatory school—with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.[36] In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \"Barry.\"[37] Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii.[38] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975, so his mother could begin anthropology field work.[39] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.[40]\n",
    "# Of his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: \"The opportunity that Hawaii offered — to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect — became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\"[41] Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \"push questions of who I was out of my mind.\"[42] Obama was also a member of the \"choom gang\", a self-named group of friends who spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.[43][44]"

A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African-American  president of the United States.[2] Obama previously served as a U.S. senator representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and as an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004, and worked as a civil rights lawyer before holding public office. \n",
      "\n",
      "Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he represented the 13th district in the Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate primary win, his well-received keynote address at the July Democratic National Convention, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president and chose Joe Biden as his running mate. Obama was elected over Republican nominee John McCain in the presidential election and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, a decision that drew a mixture of praise and criticism.\n",

      "Obama's first-term actions addressed the global financial crisis and included a major stimulus package, a partial extension of George W. Bush's tax cuts, legislation to reform health care, a major financial regulation reform bill, and the end of a major US military presence in Iraq. Obama also appointed Supreme Court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, the former being the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. He ordered the counterterrorism raid which killed Osama bin Laden and downplayed Bush's counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces while encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries.\n",

In his second term, Obama took steps to combat climate change, signing a major international climate agreement and an executive order to limit carbon emissions. Obama also presided over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and other legislation passed in his first term, and he negotiated a nuclear agreement with Iran and normalized relations with Cuba. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan fell dramatically during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in Afghanistan throughout Obama's presidency.\n",

      "During Obama's terms as president, the United States' reputation abroad and the American economy improved significantly, although the country experienced high levels of partisan divide. Obama left office on January 20, 2017, and continues to reside in Washington, D.C. His presidential library in Chicago began construction in 2021. Since leaving office, Obama has remained active in Democratic politics, including campaigning for candidates in various American elections. Outside of politics, Obama has published three bestselling books: Dreams from My Father (1995), The Audacity of Hope (2006) and A Promised Land (2020).

      "Obama was born on August 4, 1961,[6] at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii.[7][8][9] He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states.[10] He was born to an American mother and a Kenyan father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas and was of English, Welsh, German, Swiss, and Irish descent. In 2007 it was discovered her great-great-grandfather Falmouth Kearney emigrated from the village of Moneygall, Ireland to the US in 1850.[11] In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century.[12][13] Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr. (1934–1982),[14][15] was a married[16][17][18] Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo.[16][19] Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.[20][21] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.[22][23]\n",

      "In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, Barack's father completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University, where he earned an M.A. in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.[24] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the Senior Economic Analyst in the Ministry of Finance.[25] He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971,[26] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.[27] Recalling his early childhood, Obama said: \"That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind.\"[21] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[28]\n",

      "In 1963, Dunham met Lolo Soetoro at the University of Hawaii; he was an Indonesian East–West Center graduate student in geography. The couple married on Molokai on March 15, 1965.[29] After two one-year extensions of his J-1 visa, Lolo returned to Indonesia in 1966. His wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. The family initially lived in the Menteng Dalam neighborhood in the Tebet district of South Jakarta. From 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the Menteng district of Central Jakarta.[30]\n",

      "At the age of six, Obama and his mother had moved to Indonesia to join his stepfather. From age six to ten, he attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.[32][33] As a result of his four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child.[34] During his time in Indonesia, Obama's stepfather taught him to be resilient and gave him \"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works.\"[35]\n",

He attended Punahou School—a private college preparatory school—with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979.[36] In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \"Barry.\"[37] Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii.[38] Obama chose to stay in Hawaii when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975, so his mother could begin anthropology field work.[39] His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.[40]\n",

      "Of his years in Honolulu, Obama wrote: \"The opportunity that Hawaii offered — to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect — became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\"[41] Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \"push questions of who I was out of my mind.\"[42] Obama was also a member of the \"choom gang\", a self-named group of friends who spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.[43][44]\n",

      "After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College on a full scholarship. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid.[45] In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan for three weeks.[45] Later in 1981, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City as a junior, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations[46] and in English literature[47] and lived off-campus on West 109th Street.[48] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1983 and a 3.7 GPA. After graduating, Obama worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer,[49][50] then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.[51][52][53]\n",

      "Despite being offered a full scholarship to Northwestern University School of Law, Obama enrolled at Harvard Law School in the fall of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts.[60] He was selected as an editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first year,[61] president of the journal in his second year,[55][62] and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard.[63] During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990.[64] Obama's election as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention[55][62] and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations,[65] which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.[65] Obama graduated from Harvard Law in 1991 with a Juris Doctor magna cum laude.[66][61]\n",

Obama also has roots in Ireland; he met with his Irish cousins in Moneygall in May 2011.[74] In Dreams from My Father, Obama ties his mother's family history to possible Native American ancestors and distant relatives of Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.

When they moved to Washington, D.C., in January 2009, the girls started at the Sidwell Friends School.[86] The Obamas had two Portuguese Water Dogs; the first, a male named Bo, was a gift from Senator Ted Kennedy.[87] In 2013, Bo was joined by Sunny, a female.[88] Bo died of cancer on May 8, 2021.[89]\n",

The council was chaired by Senior Advisor to the President Valerie Jarrett. Obama also established the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault through a government memorandum on January 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the United States. The co-chairs of the Task Force were Vice President Joe Biden and Jarrett.

The lifting of the ban was celebrated by Immigration Equality.[235] On December 22, 2010, Obama signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which fulfilled a promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign[236][237] to end the don't ask, don't tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces.

I am not in favor of gay marriage.\"[241] On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.[242][243] During his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013,[199] Obama became the first U.S. president in office to call for full equality for gay Americans, and the first to mention gay rights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address.[244][245] In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v.

Over the following months the White House set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the sale of Chrysler to Italian automaker Fiat[252] and a reorganization of GM giving the U.S. government a temporary 60 percent equity stake in the company.[253] In June 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, Obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment.[254] He signed into law the Car Allowance Rebate System, known colloquially as \"Cash for Clunkers\", which temporarily boosted the economy.[255][256][257]\n",

The legislation enforced limits on discretionary spending until 2021, established a procedure to increase the debt limit, created a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5 trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and established automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2 trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee did not achieve such savings.[259] By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.[260]\n",

He then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review.[282] As multiple efforts by BP failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by Obama and the federal government.[283] Prior to the oil spill, on March 31, 2010, Obama ended a ban on oil and gas drilling along the majority of the East Coast of the United States and along the coast of northern Alaska in an effort to win support for an energy and climate bill and to reduce foreign imports of oil and gas.[284]\n",

His proposal was to spend $900 billion over ten years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage.

In June 2015, the Court ruled 6–3 in King v.

      "In 2013, Jeffrey Goldberg reported that, in Obama's view, \"with each new settlement announcement, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.\"[370] In 2014, Obama likened the Zionist movement to the civil rights movement in the United States. He said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples, explaining: \"To me, being pro-Israel and pro-Jewish is part and parcel with the values that I've been fighting for since I was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics.\"[371] Obama expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[372] In 2015, Obama was harshly criticized by Israel for advocating and signing the Iran Nuclear Deal; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had advocated the U.S. congress to oppose it, said the deal was \"dangerous\" and \"bad.\"[373]\n",
      "\n",
      "On December 23, 2016, under the Obama Administration, the United States abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass.[374] Netanyahu strongly criticized the Obama administration's actions,[375][376] and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million, on January 6, 2017.[377] On January 5, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted 342–80 to condemn the UN Resolution.[378][379]\n",
      "\n",
      "In February 2011, protests in Libya began against long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as part of the Arab Spring. They soon turned violent. In March, as forces loyal to Gaddafi advanced on rebels across Libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including Europe, the Arab League, and a resolution[380] passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate.[381] In response to the unanimous passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on March 17, Gaddafi—who had previously vowed to \"show no mercy\" to the rebels of Benghazi[382]—announced an immediate cessation of military activities.[383]\n",
      "\n",
      "The next day, on Obama's orders, the U.S. military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,[384] including the use of Tomahawk missiles, B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets.[385][386][387] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed Operation Unified Protector.[388] Some Representatives[389] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.[390][391] Obama later expressed regret for playing a leading role in the destabilization of Libya, calling the certain situation there \"a mess.\"[392] He has stated that the lack of preparation surrounding the days following the government's overthrow was the \"worst mistake\" of his presidency.[393]\n",
      "\n",
      "On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the Syrian civil war, Obama issued a written statement that said: \"The time has come for President Assad to step aside.\"[394] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015.[395] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels.[396] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.[397][398]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the wake of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the \"red line\" he had pledged[399] and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with chlorine gas continued.[400][401] In 2014, Obama authorized an air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL.[402]\n",
      "\n",
      "On October 1, 2009, the Obama administration went ahead with a Bush administration program, increasing nuclear weapons production. The \"Complex Modernization\" initiative expanded two existing nuclear sites to produce new bomb parts. The administration built new plutonium pits at the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico and expanded enriched uranium processing at the Y-12 facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.[citation needed] In November 2013, the Obama administration opened negotiations with Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, which included an interim agreement. Negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced on July 14, 2015. The deal titled the \"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\" saw sanctions removed in exchange for measures that would prevent Iran from producing nuclear weapons. While Obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from Republican and conservative quarters, and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.[403][404][405] In addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to Iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the Republican party. The Obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the \"effectiveness of U.S. and international sanctions.\"[406] In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded Hezbollah from the Drug Enforcement Administration's Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the Central Intelligence Agency.[407][408]\n",
      "On a side note, the very same year, in December 2015, Obama started a $348 billion worth program to back the biggest U.S. buildup of nuclear arms since Ronald Reagan left the White House.[409]\n",
      "\n",
      "In March 2010, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third.[410] Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.[411] In December 2011, Obama instructed agencies to consider LGBT rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries.[412] In August 2013, he criticized Russia's law that discriminates against gays,[413] but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.[414]\n",
      "\n",
      "After Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, military intervention in Syria in 2015, and the interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,[415] George Robertson, a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said Obama had \"allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West\", adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.[416]\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama's family history, upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the civil rights movement.[417] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is \"black enough\", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that \"we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong.\"[418] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: \"I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.\"[419] Additionally, Obama has frequently been referred to as an exceptional orator.[420] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.[421]\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68 percent approval rating[422] before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41 percent in August 2010,[423] a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office.[424] He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously.[425][426] His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52 percent shortly after his second inauguration.[427] Despite approval ratings dropping to 39 percent in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50 percent in January 2015 according to Gallup.[428]\n",
      "Polls showed strong support for Obama in other countries both before and during his presidency.[429][430][431] In a February 2009 poll conducted in Western Europe and the U.S. by Harris Interactive for France 24 and the International Herald Tribune, Obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful.[432] In a similar poll conducted by Harris in May 2009, Obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.[433][434]\n",
      "\n",
      "On October 9, 2009, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that Obama had won the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize \"for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,\"[435] which drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures.[436][437][438][439] He became the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and the third to become a Nobel laureate while in office.[440]\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama's presidency ended on January 20, 2017, upon the inauguration of his successor, Donald Trump.[441][442] The family moved to a house they rented in Kalorama, Washington, D.C.[443] On March 2, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum awarded the Profile in Courage Award to Obama \"for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage.\"[444] His first public appearance since leaving the office was a seminar at the University of Chicago on April 24, where he appealed for a new generation to participate in politics.[445] On September 7, Obama partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[446] From October 31 to November 1, Obama hosted the inaugural summit of the Obama Foundation,[447] which he intended for it to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office.[448]\n",
      "\n",
      "Barack and Michelle Obama signed a deal on May 22, 2018, to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for Netflix under the Obamas' newly formed production company, Higher Ground Productions.[449][450] Higher Ground's first film, American Factory, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2020.[451] On October 24, a pipe bomb addressed to Obama was intercepted by the Secret Service. It was one of several pipe-bombs that had been mailed out to Democratic lawmakers and officials.[452]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2019, Barack and Michelle Obama bought a home on Martha's Vineyard from Wyc Grousbeck.[453] On October 29, Obama criticized \"wokeness\" and call-out culture at the Obama Foundation's annual summit.[454][455]\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama was reluctant to make an endorsement in the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries because he wanted to position himself to unify the party, regardless of the nominee.[456] On April 14, 2020, Obama endorsed Biden, the presumptive nominee, for president in the presidential election, stating that he has \"all the qualities we need in a president right now.\"[457][458] In May, Obama criticized President Trump for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, calling his response to the crisis \"an absolute chaotic disaster\", and stating that the consequences of the Trump presidency have been \"our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before.\"[459] On November 17, Obama's presidential memoir, A Promised Land, was released.[460][461][462]\n",
      "\n",
      "In February 2021, Obama and musician Bruce Springsteen started a podcast called Renegades: Born in the USA where the two talk about \"their backgrounds, music and their 'enduring love of America.'\"[463][464] Later that year, Regina Hicks had signed a deal with Netflix, in a venture with his and Michelle's Higher Ground to develop comedy projects.[465]\n",
      "\n",
      "On March 4, 2022, Obama won an Audio Publishers Association (APA) Award in the best narration by the author category for the narration of his memoir A Promised Land.[466] On April 5, Obama visited the White House for the first time since leaving office, in an event celebrating the 12th annual anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act.[467][468][469] In June, it was announced that the Obamas and their podcast production company, Higher Ground, signed a multi-year deal with Audible.[470][471] In September, Obama visited the White House to unveil his and Michelle's official White House portraits.[472] Around the same time, he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Narrator[473] for his narration in the Netflix documentary series Our Great National Parks.[474]\n",
      "\n",
      "In March 2023, Obama traveled to Australia as a part of his speaking tour of the country. During the trip, Obama met with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and visited Melbourne for the first time.[475] Obama is reportedly being paid more than $1 million for two speeches.[476][477]\n",
      "\n",
      "Historian Julian Zelizer credits Obama with \"a keen sense of how the institutions of government work and the ways that his team could design policy proposals.\" Zelizer notes Obama's policy successes included the economic stimulus package which ended the Great Recession and the Dodd-Frank financial and consumer protection reforms, as well as the Affordable Care Act. Zelizer also notes the Democratic Party lost power and numbers of elected officials during Obama's term, saying that the consensus among historians is that Obama \"turned out to be a very effective policymaker but not a tremendously successful party builder.\" Zelizer calls this the \"defining paradox of Obama's presidency\".[478]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Brookings Institution noted that Obama passed \"only one major legislative achievement (Obamacare)—and a fragile one at that—the legacy of Obama's presidency mainly rests on its tremendous symbolic importance and the fate of a patchwork of executive actions.\"[479] David W. Wise noted that Obama fell short \"in areas many Progressives hold dear\", including the continuation of drone strikes, not going after big banks during the Great Recession, and failing to strengthen his coalition before pushing for Obamacare. Wise called Obama's legacy that of \"a disappointingly conventional president\".[480]\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama's most significant accomplishment is generally considered to be the Affordable Care Act (ACA), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. Many attempts by Senate Republicans to repeal the ACA, including a \"skinny repeal\", have thus far failed.[481] However, in 2017, the penalty for violating the individual mandate was repealed effective 2019.[482] Together with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act amendment, it represents the U.S. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.[483][484][485][486]\n",
      "\n",
      "Many commentators credit Obama with averting a threatened depression and pulling the economy back from the Great Recession.[481] According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Obama administration created 11.3 million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his term.[487] In 2010, Obama signed into effect the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Passed as a response to the financial crisis of 2007–2008, it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the United States since the regulatory reform that followed the Great Depression under Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[488]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2009, Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which contained in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President Bill Clinton signed into law the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States, and made it a federal crime to assault people based on sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.[489]\n",
      "\n",
      "As president, Obama advanced LGBT rights.[490] In 2010, he signed the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, which brought an end to \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy in the U.S. armed forces that banned open service from LGB people; the law went into effect the following year.[491] In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.[492][238] A Gallup poll, taken in the final days of Obama's term, showed that 68 percent of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress on LGBT rights during Obama's eight years in office.[493]\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama substantially escalated the use of drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban.[494] In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the U.S. dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries.[495][496] Obama left about 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.[497]\n",

      "According to Pew Research Center and United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in U.S. federal custody declined by five percent. This is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in U.S. federal custody since Democratic President Jimmy Carter. By contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.[498]\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch (HRW) called Obama's human rights record \"mixed\", adding that \"he has often treated human rights as a secondary interest — nice to support when the cost was not too high, but nothing like a top priority he championed.\"[221]\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60 percent approval rating.[499][500] He gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the Brookings Institution that ranked him the 18th-greatest American president.[501] In Gallup's 2018 job approval poll for the past 10 U.S. presidents, he received a 63 percent approval rating.[502]\n",
